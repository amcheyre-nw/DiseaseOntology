# DiseaseOntology

## Objective & Goal 

We aim to build an ontology capable of delivering psychiatric diagnoses and potential treatment options for patients given the symptoms he or she presents. Since no publicly available knowledge graph exists, this task can be split into two overarching objectives:
1. The development of data-scraping tools to build a structured medical knowledge base from online sources.
2. The creation of inference rules for each disease based on the patient's symptoms and other conditions from which we can infer certain disease diagnoses.

## Execution

### Ontology creation

### OWL file generation
